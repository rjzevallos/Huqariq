### Project Specific Guidelines

- Be kind to each other
- Remember that we are all humans, and we are all on the same team
- Be respectful of other cultures and perspectives - language is both intensely personal and political
- "Please" and "Thank you" are always nice ways to facilitate communication
- Self-care is of utmost importance (take breaks, eat food, plenty of sleep)
- Have fun
